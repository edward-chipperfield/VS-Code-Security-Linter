This is a minimal wrapper around the OpenAI ChatGPT API. 

It provides a basic interface for sending prompts and receiving responses directly from your browser or local environment. 

It could be useful for quick prototyping, testing ideas, or building on top of the OpenAI API without extra overhead. Pretty bare bones. Minimal UI, minimal error handling.

Steps to use:

1.  Clone the repo 

2.  Create a .env file with your OpenAI API key
-   If you want to change the model, edit llm-api.ts

3.  Install dependencies and build:
-   npm install
-   npm run build

4.  The production-ready files will be generated in the dist folder

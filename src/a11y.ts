ACCESSIBILITY GUIDELINES

1. Ensure all interactive elements are reachable and usable via keyboard navigation.
2. Use semantic HTML elements like \`<button>\`, \`<nav>\`, and \`<header>\` where appropriate.
3. Provide \`aria-label\`, \`aria-labelledby\`, or \`aria-describedby\` when needed for clarity.
4. All images must include descriptive \`alt\` attributes.
5. Ensure color contrast ratios meet WCAG 2.1 AA minimums.
6. Avoid using only colour to convey meaning â€” include icons, text, or shapes.
7. Include focus outlines or visible indicators for active elements.
